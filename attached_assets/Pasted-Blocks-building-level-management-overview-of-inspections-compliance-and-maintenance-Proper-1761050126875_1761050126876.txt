Blocks = building-level management (overview of inspections, compliance, and maintenance).

Properties = unit-level management (detailed data about tenants, inventory, and issues).

Both need dashboards, search/filter, document uploads, and PDF reporting.

Data must sync offline via the PWA, especially for inspectors viewing assigned properties in the field.

A Block represents a building or group of units — for example:

“Block A – Riverside Apartments” or “Tower 2 – City Heights.”

Each Block helps organise multiple properties (units) under one address or complex.

One Block can have many Properties.

Each Property belongs to only one Block.

Data flows upward:

Property inspections, maintenance, and compliance all roll up to the Block dashboard.
