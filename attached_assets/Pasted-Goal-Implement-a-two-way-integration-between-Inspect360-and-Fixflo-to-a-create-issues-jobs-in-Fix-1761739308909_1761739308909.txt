Goal

Implement a two-way integration between Inspect360 and Fixflo to (a) create issues/jobs in Fixflo from inspection findings and (b) sync status/attachments/invoices back to Inspect360 via webhooks and periodic pulls.

Environments & Secrets

Use Fixflo Sandbox first; production later.

Base URL (example): https://api-sandbox.fixflo.com/api/v2

Store secrets in Replit environment variables:

FIXFLO_BASE_URL

FIXFLO_BEARER_TOKEN (scoped to the client’s Fixflo tenant)

WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN (for verifying incoming webhooks)

Add per-tenant config if we multi-tenant Inspect360.

(Ref: Bearer token auth in Fixflo docs.) 
api-docs.fixflo.com

Data model mapping

Create a mapping layer so we never hard-code strings:

Inspect360.Property ↔ Fixflo.Property/Asset/Block (store fixfloPropertyId)

Inspect360.Issue ↔ Fixflo.Issue/Job (store fixfloIssueId)

Stakeholders: (optional) Tenant/Landlord/Contractor/Agent ↔ Fixflo equivalents (store external IDs)

Attachments: map photos/videos from Inspect360 to Fixflo file uploads (where supported) and vice-versa using Fixflo binary download guidance. 
api-docs.fixflo.com

Outbound calls (Inspect360 → Fixflo)

Create Issue

Endpoint: use the Fixflo Issues API (per docs).

Payload fields (minimum): propertyId, summary/description, priority, category, reporter (if known), and attachments (URLs or multipart as per API guidance).

On success: persist fixfloIssueId in Inspect360.

Update Issue

Use Update endpoints to set AssignedAgent (contractor/agent), priority, due date, etc. (There is a documented endpoint for updating AssignedAgent.) 
api-docs.fixflo.com

Resync entities (optional)

If we choose to push new properties/tenants to Fixflo, implement create/update endpoints accordingly (see entities list in docs). 
api-docs.fixflo.com

Inbound webhooks (Fixflo → Inspect360)

Expose POST /integrations/fixflo/webhook in Inspect360 (public HTTPS).

Verify requests (shared secret in header, IP allowlist if available; store delivery items & retry if necessary).

Handle events such as: IssueCreated, IssueUpdated, ContractorAssigned, JobCompleted, InvoiceAdded, AttachmentAdded (event names vary; read the Webhook section and model in docs).

Persist the payload, then update:

Issue status & timestamps

Assigned contractor info

Costs/invoice totals

Attachments (download using the secure binary guidance in docs)

Activity log/audit trail

Return 2xx quickly; queue internal processing.

Pull endpoints (for dashboards/KPIs)

Implement scheduled pulls for lists like JobCompleted to backfill or sanity-check webhook streams:

Example: GET /Issues/JobCompleted with date filters.

Reconcile with local state (idempotent upserts). 
api-docs.fixflo.com

Error handling & observability

Retry policy for transient 5xx and 429 (respect Retry-After).

Dead-letter queue for failed webhooks.

Integration health page: last successful call, last webhook, error counts.

Security

Never log PII or tokens.

Rotate FIXFLO_BEARER_TOKEN regularly.

Validate all inbound webhook signatures/tokens.

Respect any Fixflo rate limits.

UI/UX in Inspect360

When a BRE flags “Maintenance required,” show “Send to Fixflo” → confirm property mapping → allow user to:

Edit summary/priority/category

Attach inspection photos

Select or auto-assign contractor (if your org rules allow)

On the Issue detail, show Fixflo Status, Assigned Contractor, Target/SLA, Invoices, Attachments, with deep-link to Fixflo portal.

Testing plan

Use sandbox token + a test property; create an issue from a test inspection.

Trigger Fixflo status changes in sandbox; confirm webhooks update the local record.

Upload attachment in Fixflo; ensure Inspect360 ingests it.

Try “AssignedAgent” update from Inspect360; verify in Fixflo.
